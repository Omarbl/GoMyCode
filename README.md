# This repository is dedicated to the GoMyCode's Introduction to AI course 
During this one-month intensive course, I learned what Artificial Intelligence is about, what basic techniques are used for supervised and unsupervised learning. Important milestones like data preprocessing, EDA and model validation are also introduced and implemented on examples using Kaggle databases. 
To complete this course, I implemented all the knowledge acquired in a project of my choice: Tayara-Project. It aims to predict the price of car based on its features.
